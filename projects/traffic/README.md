Using the same parameters as the video, the accuracy is really low, as expected as this has higher ammount of data, more nodes will be needed. Using two times the parameters has better results but still low. Adding another hidden layer worked really well, got it to 91% accuracy.
Next, to get that last 10, I will add another hidden layer. The results are arround the same as before, the third hidden layer seems unneecary here. Removing it and doubling the nodes again gives similar results as before doubling, just took longer to load. I'll leave it at 256, and instead try to add more pooling and convolution layers. I'll go from 32 to 64. Once its raised to 128, it reaches 97%.
